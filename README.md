# Ferric-Iron-Prediction-in-Mantle-Garnets
This repository contains all codes, scripts, and notebooks developed for the project "Fe³⁺/∑Fe Prediction in Mantle Garnets Using Machine Learning".

The project integrates geochemical data analysis, machine learning model development, and statistical validation techniques to predict ferric iron content across various geological datasets.

Key components include:

Data collation and pre-processing

Exploratory data analysis (PCA analysis, Outlier detection)

Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Linear Regression etc.)

Visualization of model performance

Application to independent geological datasets (different cratons)

The goal is to create a reproducible, scalable workflow for mineralogical data interpretation.
